Steps for running the analysis:

1. Run rep_analysis.py
2. Select pickle file that represents a Repertoire database.
3. Press Next
4. It gives four analysis option:

  1. Porting Trend
  2. File distribution
  3. Developer's Distribution
  4. Timing Analysis

Porting Trend
==============
1. Select the project you are analyzing: project 0 or/and project 1  
2. You can select some time peiod to analyze (X from to to)
3. Bird's eye view shows a birds eye view of file distribution for the selected time period

File Distribution
==================
1. Shows a scatter plot of file distribution, i.e., a point is plotted at
(x,y) if there is a port from file x to file y or vice versa.
2. We do not show file names as label, as for large number of files it clutters the display. User can see labels, if "Display Label" is pressed.
3. If any point on the diagram is pressed, corresponding files names can also be seen at the bottom.
4. To browse the ported code between selected file pair, press "Display porting"
5. A window will show all the ported code between the two files, along with developer's data and commit date.
6. On selecting any clone from clone list, user can browse the ported edit.

Developer's Distribution
=========================
1. Shows a scatter plot of developer distribution, i.e., a point is plotted at (x,y) if there devlopers at x port code from developer at y, and vice versa.
2. We do not show developers names as label initially, as it clutters the display. User can see labels however, if "Display Label" is pressed.
3. If any point on the diagram is pressed, corresponding developer names can be seen at the bottom.
4. To check developer's contribution in ported edits, please select project0 and/or project 1 from right hand window. Then press "Display Developer's Porting Statistics"
  
Timing Analysis
===============
1. Select project 0 and/or 1 to see port latency. 
2. Press "Porting latency" button.
3. A cumulative distribution of the latency can also be seen by pressing "Cumulative Distribution" button.
4. User can also seletct a time frame by specifying "X from" and "to".
